# Empirical Evaluation of Gated Recurrent Neural Networks on Sequence Modeling

This directory contains some notebooks for debugging:
* `music_data_check`: Shows examples of what the music data in inputs and outputs should look like.
* `training_objective_plots`: Plots the training and validation loss and metrics.
* `training_visualizations`: Shows how the predictions changed throughout training.
* `translation_inference`: Conduct translation inference for some sentences.
